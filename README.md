# Learn Cloud with Me
Hello!! I started my cloud journey a few years back. I got my Azure foundation exam and then I was not able to pursue it. Now, during lockdown 2020 I started my cloud journey again, and thanks to my workplace for pushing me into AWS. Again after a few hiccups, I pushed myself to learn AWS and get my 1st certification too.

Now, I am giving back to the community by doing 1 session at a time to help developers start their journey in the cloud.

This repo will hold the links to my sessions and PPTs.
